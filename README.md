# BitChat MAUI

## Project Overview

BitChat MAUI is a cross-platform port of the original iOS/macOS BitChat application, implementing a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging system that operates over Bluetooth mesh networks. This revolutionary messaging platform requires no internet connectivity, servers, or user accounts - enabling truly private, offline communication.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Mesh Networking**: Messages hop through multiple Bluetooth connections to reach distant peers
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No servers, no accounts, no phone numbers, no internet required
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Implements Noise Protocol Framework (XX pattern) for secure private messaging
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows
- **Privacy-First**: Ephemeral messages, no persistent storage, emergency data wipe capability
- **Dual Transport**: Automatically switches between Bluetooth mesh and Nostr protocol for mutual favorites
- **IRC-Style Interface**: Familiar commands like `/msg`, `/nick`, `/who` for power users

## Development Approach

This project is being developed through **pair programming** between a human developer and Claude (AI assistant). We're building this MAUI implementation from scratch while maintaining 100% feature parity with the original Swift version.

### Our Process

- **Collaborative Development**: Each feature is discussed, planned, and implemented together
- **Iterative Building**: We work in focused chunks, testing as we go
- **Knowledge Preservation**: All design decisions and implementation details are documented
- **Cross-Platform First**: Every feature is built to work across all target platforms

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8 MAUI**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **C# 12**: Primary development language
- **Plugin.BLE**: Bluetooth Low Energy functionality
- **NSec.Cryptography**: Curve25519 and ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: MVVM pattern implementation
- **SQLite**: Local encrypted storage (when needed)
