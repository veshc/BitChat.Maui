# BitChat MAUI - Agile Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

BitChat is a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that enables secure communication over Bluetooth mesh networks without requiring internet connectivity, servers, or user accounts. This document outlines the requirements for migrating the iOS/macOS Swift application to a cross-platform .NET MAUI implementation while maintaining complete feature parity.

**Vision**: Create a censorship-resistant, privacy-first communication platform that works in situations where traditional infrastructure is unavailable or untrusted.

**Scope**: Full-featured MAUI application supporting iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms with identical functionality to the existing Swift implementation.
